#MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
#We have a big multidimensional table of species and we want to lower the amount of these dimension
#in the interested site (area) 
#we divide the area in square (plot)
#we have three pllot to deal with PLOT1 PLOT2 PLOT3
#first: parnassius guccinii butterfly . P1:13, P2:1 P3:2
#second: orchys flower: P1:15, P2:2, P3:3 
#Third: larix decidua: P1:3, P2:10, P3:8
#in the last plot the pattern is different
#butterfly and flowers are more related to eachother than the trees
#we can do a matrix of the plots

#we have several plots
#axis1
#axis2
#we've several individuals distributed in a highly correlated system
#x axis is containing 50% of the all individual
#same for y
#the first xis is component1 which is actually containing 90% of original rate
#second component is containing 10%
#we pass to the component1 which is just one axis 
#we don't have x and y anymore but
#component1 with 90% of the individuals
#we reduce the dimension
#this is called
#PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS

#library doesnt need quotes since we installed the package

#head shows the first six line
#another manner is to do
View(dune)

#decorana: detrended correspondence analysis
#principal component analysis but powerfull when the range of data are quite disperse
#this functio compact the data
ord <- decorana(dune)
#we assigned the function to ord
ord
#we're going to pass from the original seto to four axis
#lenght of each axis is written in the Axis lenght
#lenght menas the amount of range represented by each axis
#aim: what is the percentage of the original range (variance) incorporated in just two axis
#the maximum amount of axis we can use is three

ldc1 =  3.7004 
ldc2 =  3.1166 
ldc3 = 1.30055
ldc4 = 1.47888

#how to calculate the percentage

total = ldc1 + ldc2 + ldc3 + ldc4
total

#proportion
pldc1 = ldc1  / total
pldc2 = ldc2  / total
pldc3 = ldc3  / total
pldc4 = ldc4  / total

#percentages
percldc1 = ldc1 * 100 / total
percldc2 = ldc2 * 100 / total
percldc3 = ldc3 * 100 / total
percldc4 = ldc4 * 100 / total


percldc1
percldc2

#final set of two axis using 71% of variability
percldc1 + percldc2
#plot the name of the analysis
plot(ord) 
#black numbers ae the original plot
#species living together

#better to use "assign" rather than eual when we have a function
