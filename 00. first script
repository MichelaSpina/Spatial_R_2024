#assign an object to a value
2-3
michela <- 2-3 
michela ##for seeing the result

##another example
lea <- 3+4 
lea
#another operation inside lea
michela + lea
michela ^ lea
#since i have the object i can use it directly

#another operation that is called array
#let's put all the number of some individuals
10,20,30,50,70 #this is an array
#to put it all together we use the function c (concatenate)
tommaso <- c(10, 20, 30, 50, 70)
#we assigned tommaso the the array
tommaso
#let's imagine we want to detect other staff in the same point 
#i want to see if the first data (cannabis from tommaso's research)
#can defend the biodiversity we found in the same point
erica <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
erica
#we have the two data
#so now we can make a plot using the function
#plot()
#inside the parentesis we have the arguments
plot(tommaso, erica)
#generally arguments are separeted by a comma, we can also use extra space after the comma

#change color
plot(tommaso, erica, col="blue")
#change the point character in the graph
plot(tommaso, erica , pch=19, col="blue")
#you can search for the colo in R on internet
#can change the dimension as well with cex
plot(tommaso, erica , pch=19, col="blue", cex=3)
#the dimension is decreased if we put 0.5,0.6 etc
#additional thing is changing the text 
plot(tommaso, erica , pch=19, col="blue", cex=3, xlab="cannabis", ylab="dolphin")
#everytime i have text i need quotes, if i have number i don't use it

#MESSAGE OF THE LECTURE
#Concept of an object
#concept of assign symbols
#array
#function concept like: c(),  plot()
